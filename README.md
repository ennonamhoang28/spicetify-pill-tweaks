Enno's Pill-Shaped Player & Visual Fixes
A collection of personal CSS tweaks to enhance the Spotify interface. The main feature is transforming the bottom player bar into a sleek, floating "pill" shape. It also includes several fixes to improve visual compatibility when using other popular snippets.

Works well with the base Spotify client and most themes (including Hazy).

Designed to work alongside:
This CSS is primarily created to handle visual glitches and create a cohesive look when using these 3 popular snippets together (install them first from the Marketplace):

Spinning CD Cover Art (for the small Now Playing bar animation).

Circular Album Art (for the large sidebar cover).

Rounded Images (for general UI consistency).

What does this CSS do?
💊 Pill-Shaped Player Bar: Transforms the bottom player control bar into a floating, fully rounded "pill" shape with a modern glass effect.

🔲 Rounded Square Library Icons: Forces the default circular artist and album icons in the left sidebar (Your Library) into uniform rounded squares.

💿 Vinyl & CD Fixes:

"Ghostbuster" Fix: Removes the ugly square shadow artifact that can appear behind spinning CD snippets in the small player bar.

Solid Vinyl Mode: Ensures the large cover art in the right sidebar is a solid vinyl record (filling the center hole), while keeping the spinning CD effect in the small player bar below.

How to use
Just copy the content of the user.css file from this repository and paste it into your Spicetify user.css config file.

Enjoy!
