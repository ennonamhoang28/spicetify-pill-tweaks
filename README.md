Enno's Personal Tweaks for Hazy Theme
A collection of personal CSS adjustments I made to tidy up the Spotify interface when using the Hazy theme. It mainly focuses on aesthetics and fixing some visual compatibility issues with other popular snippets.

Designed to work alongside:
I created this CSS specifically to handle visual glitches and enhance the look when using these 3 popular snippets together (you should install them first from the Marketplace for the full effect):

Spinning CD Cover Art (for the small Now Playing bar animation).

Circular Album Art (for the large sidebar cover).

Rounded Images (for general UI consistency).

What does this CSS do?
This snippet applies the following changes on top of those:

Pill-Shaped Player Bar: Transforms the bottom player control bar into a floating, fully rounded "pill" shape with an ultra-clear glass effect.

Squared Library Icons: Forces the default circular artist and album icons in the left sidebar (Your Library) into rounded squares for a more consistent look.

Vinyl & CD Fixes:

Ghostbuster Fix: Removes the square shadow artifact that often appears behind spinning CD snippets in the small player bar.

Solid Vinyl Mode: Forces the large cover art in the right sidebar to be a "solid vinyl" record (filling the center hole), while keeping the spinning CD effect in the small player bar below.

How to use
Just copy the content of user.css and paste it into your Spicetify user.css file.

Enjoy!
